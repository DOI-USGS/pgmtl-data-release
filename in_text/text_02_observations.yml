  Walleye Thermal Optical Habitat Area (TOHA) of selected Minnesota lakes: 2 Water temperature observations

abstract: >-
  Observed water temperatures from 1980-2018 were compiled for 903 lakes in Minnesota (USA). These data were used
  as training, test, and error-estimation data for process-guided deep learning models and the evaluation of process-based models.
  The data are formatted as a single csv (comma separated values) file with attributes corresponding to the unique combination of
  lake identifier, time, and depth. Data came from a variety of sources, including the Water Quality Portal,
  the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research Project, and digitized temperature
  records from the MN Department of Natural Resources.
  This dataset is part of a larger data release of lake temperature model inputs and outputs for 909 lakes in the U.S.
  state of Minnesota (https://doi.org/10.5066/P9PPHJE2).
