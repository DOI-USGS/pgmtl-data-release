  Predicting Water Temperature Dynamics of Unmonitored Lakes with Meta Transfer Learning: 1 Lake information for 2,332 lakes (Provisional Data Release)

abstract: >-
  <p>These data are preliminary or provisional and are subject to revision. They are being provided to meet the need for timely best science. 
  The data have not received final approval by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and are provided on the condition that neither the USGS 
  nor the U.S. Government shall be held liable for any damages resulting from the authorized or unauthorized use of the data.

  <br/>
  This dataset provides shapefile outlines of the 2,332 lakes that had temperature modeled as part of this study.
  The format is a shapefile for all lakes combined (.shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj files). A csv file of lake metadata is included, which includes lake metadata
  and all features that were considered for the meta transfer model (not all meta features were used).
  This dataset is part of a larger data release of lake temperature model inputs and outputs for 2,332 lakes in the U.S.

      attr-label: obs_depth_mean_frac
      attr-def: >-
        The mean of depth observations as a fraction of the maximum reported depth for the lake. This number exceeds 1 
        in the case where the mean depth of observations was greater than the reported maximum depth of the lake, in those cases, the observations
        below the maximum depth were excluded. This happened in some cases because a deeper basin was considered part of the same lake for 
        temperature monitoring purposes, but considered a separate lake for reporting maximum depth, or is indicative of errors. A value of 
        0 for a given lake means all measurements were taken at the surface. This value was not used as a metafeature for target lakes, 
        even though it appears  in the data release.

      attr-label: zero_temp_doy
      attr-def: >-
        Across all years of driver data (1980-2019), the average air temperature for each day of year (DOY) is calculated. 
        DOY is between 1 and 366, with 1 representing January first. The zero_temp_doy is the first DOY when five days in 
        a row of subzero temperatures exist for the DOY averages.

      attr-label: glm_strat_perc
      attr-def: >-
        Using the PB0 simulation temperature outputs (uncalibrated General Lake Model), this metric represents the fraction
        of days where stratification (as specified by any time the difference between top and bottom temperatures exceeded 1 degree C)
        existed. A glm_strat_perc value of 0 would mean this lake was simulated by PB0 to never be stratified, and a value of 1 
        would mean this lake was simulated to be stratified constantly.

      attr-label: SDF
      attr-def: >-
        The shoreline development factor is the ratio of the lake perimeter to the perimeter of a circle with equal area. 
        The SDF is a metric of shoreline complexity, and a high SDF is indicative of a complex lake shape. When the lake is a 
        perfect circle, the SDF is 1 (1 is the lowest possible value of SDF). SDF is unitless.
