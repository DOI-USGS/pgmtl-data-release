  Predicting Water Temperature Dynamics of Unmonitored Lakes with Meta Transfer Learning: 1 Lake information for 2,332 lakes

abstract: >-
  This dataset provides shapefile outlines of the 2,332 lakes that had temperature modeled as part of this study.
  The format is a shapefile for all lakes combined (.shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj files). A csv file of lake metadata is also included.
  This dataset is part of a larger data release of lake temperature model inputs and outputs for 2,332 lakes in the U.S.
