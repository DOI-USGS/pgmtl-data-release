  Climate change has been shown to influence lake temperatures in different ways. To better understand the diversity of lake responses to climate change and give managers tools to manage individual lakes,
  we focused on improving prediction accuracy for daily water temperature profiles in 2,233 lakes in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan during 1980-2019.

process-description: >-
  This data release includes predictions generated from various types of models, including a process-guided deep learning (PGDL) model and the general lake model (GLM). 
  Both model types use inputs of lake-specific properties and local meteorology to estimate water temperature. The PGDL model is described in Read et al. 2019 and the GLM 
  is described in Hipsey et al. 2019 and an example of its application elsewhere is in Winslow et al. 2017. In order to test the accuracy of applying these models on lakes with 
  no observations, a meta-transfer learning model was designed that selects a calibrated or trained source model from GLM or PGDL to be applied on a target lake. This data release
  includes the metadata necessary to build these models, the input data necessary to drive these models, outputs from the models, and the data used to train/calibrate and evaluate
  model performance.
