  Predicting Water Temperature Dynamics of Unmonitored Lakes with Meta Transfer Learning: 5 Model prediction data

abstract: >-
  Multiple modeling frameworks were used to predict daily temperatures at 0.5m depth intervals for a set of diverse lakes in the U.S.
  states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. Process-Based (PB) models were configured and calibrated with training data to reduce root-mean squared error.
  Uncalibrated models used default configurations (PB0; see Winslow et al. 2016 for details) and no parameters were adjusted according to model fit with observations.
  Deep Learning (DL) models were Long Short-Term Memory artificial recurrent neural network models which used training data to adjust model structure and weights for temperature predictions (Jia et al. 2019).
  Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) models were DL models with an added physical constraint for energy conservation as a loss term. These models were pre-trained with
  uncalibrated Process-Based model outputs (PB0) before training on actual temperature observations.

  For PB and PB0 predictions we used USGS Advanced Research Computing, USGS Yeti Supercomputer (https://doi.org/10.5066/F7D798MJ); process-based predictions were generated with the following open source tools available in the R programming language (R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23)).\n
  The computing platform for generating data and metadata was x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu. R packages loaded into this environment: dplyr, version: 0.8.1; glmtools, version: 0.15.0; rLakeAnalyzer, version: 1.11.4; GLMr, version: 3.1.14; readr, version: 1.3.1;
  Yeti modules tools/nco-4.7.8-gnu; tools/netcdf-4.3.2-gnu
  For PGDL and DL predictions, the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute resources were used.
