  Climate change and land use change have been shown to influence lake temperatures and water clarity in different ways. To better understand the diversity of lake responses to
  climate change and give managers tools to manage individual lakes, we focused on improving prediction accuracy for daily water
  temperature profiles in 2,332 lakes during 1980-2019.
  <br/>The data are organized into these items:</p>
